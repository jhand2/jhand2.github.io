What is the URL of this project on your student web
server?

	You can actually find this hosted at 
	www.jhand.me (can also use jhand2.github.io)

	I used github pages hosting and then had my DNS
	reference that hosted content.

	(Note: does not support https)

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.

	Stack overflow and CSS from http://sixrevisions.com/css/responsive-background-image/

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

	8-10ish hours. Although a significant portion of that
	was trying to host the website with my custom domain.

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we
should warn students about in the future?
How can we make the challenge better?

	I loved this assignment. Very open ended and allowed 
	us to make something useful

	I am particularly proud of the background image. I edited it myself :)
